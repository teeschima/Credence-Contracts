# Error Handling — Credence Contracts

## Overview

All Credence smart contracts share a single error type: `ContractError`, defined in the `credence_errors` crate. Every public entry-point returns `Result<T, ContractError>` so callers always receive a typed, categorized, wire-stable error code instead of an opaque transaction failure.

## Error Code Layout

| Range    | Category       | Contracts                                      |
|----------|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1-99     | Initialization | all (bond, registry, delegation, treasury, etc.) |
| 100-199  | Authorization  | all (bond, registry, delegation, treasury, etc.) |
| 200-299  | Bond           | credence_bond                                  |
| 300-399  | Attestation    | credence_bond, delegation                      |
| 400-499  | Registry       | credence_registry                              |
| 500-599  | Delegation     | credence_delegation                            |
| 600-699  | Treasury       | credence_treasury                              |
| 700-799  | Arithmetic     | bond, treasury, and others                     |

> **Stability Guarantee** — Error codes are wire-stable and must never be renumbered after deployment. New variants are appended at the end of their category block only.

## Workspace Integration

### Adding credence_errors to Cargo.toml
```toml
[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = "22.0", features = ["testutils"] }
credence_errors = { path = "../../contracts/credence_errors" }

[dev-dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = "22.0", features = ["testutils"] }
```

### Importing errors in contracts
```rust
use credence_errors::ContractError;
use soroban_sdk::panic_with_error;

// In fallible functions:
pub fn some_function(...) -> Result<..., ContractError> {
    ...
    Err(ContractError::SomeError)?
}

// In panicking functions (for initialization, config):
pub fn initialize(...) -> Result<..., ContractError> {
    if already_initialized {
        panic_with_error!(e, ContractError::AlreadyInitialized);
    }
    ...
    Ok(())
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use `?` operator** for fallible entry-points that return `Result<T, ContractError>`.
2. **Use `panic_with_error!`** for initialization and configuration that cannot fail gracefully.
3. **Never panic with ad-hoc strings** — always map to canonical error codes.
4. **Document error cases** in function docs, referencing the error code.
5. **Test both success and failure** — include at least one test per error code path.
6. **Preserve error codes** — never renumber or remove variants from the canonical taxonomy.

## FAQ

**Q: What if I need a custom error message?**  
A: Use the error code to identify the failure type. Off-chain indexers and clients decode the error code; custom messages can be reconstructed from the code if needed.

**Q: Can I add new error codes?**  
A: Yes, but only by appending to the end of the applicable category block. Never insert in the middle or renumber existing codes.

**Q: What about panics from dependencies?**  
A: Map library panics to canonical errors at contract boundaries. For example, overflow from checked_mul should return `Overflow` (code 700).

**Q: How do tests validate error codes?**  
A: Use `try_*` client methods with `matches!()` or `#[should_panic(expected = "Error(Contract, #NNN)")]` annotations.
