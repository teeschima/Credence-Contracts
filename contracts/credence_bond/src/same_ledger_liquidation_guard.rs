//! Same-ledger collateral increase vs slashing guard.
//!
//! ## Rationale
//!
//! In one ledger, transaction ordering can let a slash ("liquidation") run in the
//! same block as a collateral increase ("borrow" / top-up). That enables unfair,
//! sandwich-like outcomes against the bond holder. Recording the ledger sequence
//! whenever collateral is added and rejecting slashes while it still matches the
//! current ledger closes that edge case.
//!
//! This is **not** a protocol-wide throttle: it only touches slash entry points and
//! does not limit attestations, withdrawals, or unrelated accounts.

/// Panics if the last collateral increase happened in the current ledger.
///
/// If the key was never set (e.g. pre-upgrade storage), slashing is allowed so
/// existing bonds are not bricked.
