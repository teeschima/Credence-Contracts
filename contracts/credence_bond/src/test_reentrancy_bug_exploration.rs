//! Bug Condition Exploration Test - Reentrancy Vulnerability
//!
//! **Validates: Requirements 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4**
//!
//! This test demonstrates the reentrancy vulnerability in withdraw_bond(), withdraw_early(),
//! and execute_cooldown_withdrawal() functions. These functions perform external token transfers
//! before completing state updates, violating the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern.
//!
//! **CRITICAL**: This test is EXPECTED TO FAIL on unfixed code - failure confirms the bug exists.
//! The test encodes the expected behavior (reentrancy should be blocked).
//!
//! **Property 1: Bug Condition** - Reentrancy Attack Demonstration
//!
//! The test demonstrates that:
//! 1. withdraw_bond() lacks reentrancy protection (no acquire_lock/release_lock calls)
//! 2. withdraw_early() lacks reentrancy protection (no acquire_lock/release_lock calls)
//! 3. execute_cooldown_withdrawal() lacks reentrancy protection (no acquire_lock/release_lock calls)
//!
//! When the fix is implemented, this test will PASS, confirming reentrancy protection is added.
