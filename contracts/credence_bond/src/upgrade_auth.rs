//! # UUPS Upgrade Authorization Module
//!
//! Implements secure upgrade authorization for UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard)
//! with role-based access control and explicit authorization checks.
//!
//! ## Features
//! - Role-based upgrade authorization
//! - Explicit upgrade authorization with custom errors
//! - Proxy compatibility safeguards
//! - Upgrade history tracking
