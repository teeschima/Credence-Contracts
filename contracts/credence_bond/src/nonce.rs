//! Replay attack prevention using per-identity nonces and deadline enforcement.
//!
//! Each identity has a nonce that must be included in state-changing calls.
//! The contract rejects replayed transactions by requiring nonce to match
//! the stored value, then incrementing it.
//!
//! Deadline enforcement ensures signatures cannot be used after expiry,
//! preventing long-lived replay windows. An optional grace window can be
//! configured by the admin to absorb minor ledger-inclusion delays near the
//! deadline boundary — it is DISABLED (0) by default.
//!
//! Domain binding ties each operation to the specific contract address,
//! blocking cross-contract replay.
